# DeepGuru AI

DeepGuru is a twitter bot generating inspirational quotes. It uses deep learning to generate tweets.

## Technology

The bot uses the [ULMFiT model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146).

It is trained on a corpus of tweets created for this task (2 corpora of ~4k tweets).
Because the ULMFiT model is pre-trained on an extract of Wikipedia, it is able to train well with a small dataset (~4k tweets for the first version).

## How it works

The process is the following:

- Create a dataset with tweets of the target style (in DeepGuru case, philosophical and zen tweets)
- Fine-train the ULMFiT english model on the corpus (Notebook "Model Training")
- Use the trained model to generate tweets (script "QuoteGenerator.py")
- Selection step: Filter the generated tweets (Notebook "Post-processing of generated quotes")
    - At the moment, there is a manual step of filtering the generated tweets. The tweets are not modified but around 30% are rejected
    - I am working on a second neural network to automatically select the best generated tweets
- Twitter bot: Tweet a few times a day using the generated data, with a cron task (script "bot.py")

## Next steps

- Write a technical post with an  in-depth explanation of the approach and technical parts
- Finalize the second neural network to automatically select the best generated tweets
- Experiment with data: new corpus and mixing  of corpus
- Experiment with the generation algorithm
- Experiment with model: test other models like google BERT
